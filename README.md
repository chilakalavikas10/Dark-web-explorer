**Tor Interaction Tool**

**Overview**:
- Enhanced usability, security, and anonymity for interacting with .onion domains on the Tor network.
- Comprehensive features for searching, analyzing, and interacting with dark web resources.

**Features**:

- **Search Over Tor**:
  - Utilized dark web search engines (DuckDuckGo, Ahmia, Torch) to find relevant .onion domains.

- **Anonymity and Privacy**:
  - Identified and managed Tor entry (guard) and exit nodes for anonymity.
  - Implemented circuit rebuilding to maintain security.
  - Ensured IP masking through Tor network routing.

- **TOR Whois Information**:
  - Retrieved WHOIS-like information for .onion domains.
  - Extracted metadata about .onion sites (creation date, update date, descriptions).

- **Screenshots**:
  - Captured visual snapshots of .onion websites.
  - Grabbed HTTP response headers for site configuration and behavior analysis.

- **Subdirectories**:
  - Identified and listed subdirectories of onion web-servers.
  - Mapped out subdirectories for structured site content view.

**Technical Implementation**:

- Integrated with Tor client to establish secure connections.
- Interfaced with dark web search engines via APIs or scraping techniques.
- Managed and rebuilt Tor circuits dynamically using Torâ€™s control port.
- Utilized web crawling libraries compatible with Tor for site traversal.
- Employed headless browsing tools (Selenium, Puppeteer) for screenshot capture over Tor.
- Gathered WHOIS information from available resources and databases.

**Security Considerations**:

- Ensured end-to-end encryption for all data exchanges over the Tor network.
- Maintained a no-logging policy to ensure user privacy.
- Regularly updated security protocols to protect against vulnerabilities.

**Use Cases**:

- Beneficial for cybersecurity researchers studying dark web activities.
- Assisted investigative journalists in securely exploring and documenting dark web content.
- Supported law enforcement agencies in tracking and analyzing dark web sites.
- Empowered privacy advocates and organizations advocating for online anonymity.
